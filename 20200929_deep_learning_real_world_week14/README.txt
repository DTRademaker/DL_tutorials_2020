We discussed how the basic architectures are often not suficient to solve real world problems.

Shown an example how an architecture was designed for a specific problem. (image annotation given an photo)

Shown how another paper tried to solve their some what similar problem by copying the architecture.

Show how and why this architecture is not suitiable for their specific problem.

Show how our group had solved the problem using a far less complex and flexiable model

Summarize how new architectures can be build based on the existing ones, and that often you have to build specific ones for specific problems.

Free discussions about te deep learning course, what the other members like to see in the future

They suggested the following:

-How to handle inbalaced datasets
-hyperparameter optimization
-dataset development

Also they said they loved the combination of the more intuitive classes and the more mathematical classes.
